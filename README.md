# Git on the Server - Git Daemon + Post-Receive Hook

Git daemon serving repositories over the "Git" protocol.
This is common choice for fast, unauthenticated access to your Git data.
Remember that since itâ€™s not an authenticated service, anything you serve over this protocol is public within its network.

Additional post-receive hook used to set server working directory to `/var/www/public`

Post-receive hook forces each checkout, since we want to make sure `git push` is successful each time,
even if there are conflicts between what is currently in the working directory.

## How-to

Create two folders: project - a test git repository, html - git-server volume

```
mkdir project html
```

### Remote Server:

```
mkdir proj html
docker run -p 9418:9418 -v "$(pwd)/html:/var/www/public" gallna/git:git
```

### Client Machine:

Create sample git repository

```
cd ~/project
echo "<h2>It works</h2>" >> index.html
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Trying out git server"
```

Push it to git server

```
git remote add local git://localhost/`
git push local master
git push -u local master
```

See previously created html folder

## Features

- git daemon - listening on port 9418
- post-receive hook - a script invoked by git-receive-pack on the remote repository, which happens when a git push is done on a local repository.
